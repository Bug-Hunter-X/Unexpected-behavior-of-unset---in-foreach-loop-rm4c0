This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in PHP related to the use of unset() within a foreach loop.  When you unset an element in an array while iterating through it using foreach, the loop's internal pointer may behave unexpectedly. This can result in elements being skipped or the loop terminating prematurely.  The example showcases how modifying the array during iteration can lead to unexpected results compared to the intended behavior. The solution provides an alternative approach to achieve the desired array manipulation without the unexpected behavior.
